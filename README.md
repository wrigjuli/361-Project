# 361-Project
"A place for Group 29 to create and share code"

This project was for CS 361 or Software Engineering. As a group we designed some functionality for a website for a Charity page called "Donate Wisely".  It is written in Javascript and Handlebars.  It uses node.js for the server-side code.
